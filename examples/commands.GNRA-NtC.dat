# In this example, we create a hairpin with a three base pair stem and a four base loop.
# You can compare this to the tetraloop found in the large subunit of the yeast mitochondrial ribosome, PDB ID 5MRC, residues 2639 to 2648.

# Note that in the above the first residue stretch is rising, the second is falling. This is because the strands are antiparallel. Respect this syntax!

# Or, equivalently, you can apply the base pairs individually::
#baseInteraction A 2641 WatsonCrick A 2646 WatsonCrick Cis 
#baseInteraction A 2640 WatsonCrick A 2647 WatsonCrick Cis 
#baseInteraction A 2639 WatsonCrick A 2648 WatsonCrick Cis

#In prior editions of MMB we set the helical stacking using baseInteractions which could be automatically applied. This is actually still pretty useful, though if parameters change it could start to make sense to turn that off:
#setHelicalStacking False

#Why? Because now we have a better way to make nice helices. And actually many other dinucleotide steps. Thanks to Emmanuel Peter, Bohdan Schneider, and Jiri Cerny, who implemented NtCs in MMB.
#The following imposes the NtC of type AA00 -- the most typical A-form stacking dinucleotide step -- to the dinucleotide formed by residues 2656 and 2657. The last parameter is a force constant:
NtC A 1   3   AA00 .5
#NtC A 2640 2641 AA00 .5
# And now we do the same thing on the other strand:
NtC A 8   10  AA00 .5
#NtC A 2647 2648 AA00 .5
