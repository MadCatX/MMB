# Here is a list of the NtC classes we will compare our structure to. Actually you should add more NtCs, you can put all of them here:
NtC V 5 6                           BB00 1.0
NtC V 5 6                           AA00 1.0
NtC V 5 6                           AAS1 1.0
NtC V 5 6                           BB17 1.0
NtC V 5 6                           OP06 1.0
NtC V 5 6                           IC02 1.0
NtC V 5 6                           AB03 1.0
# Then run as e.g.
#  MMB -c commands.identify-NtC.dat  | grep "RMSD Angle sum for NtC"
#  Output will look like this:
#  339  RMSD Angle sum for NtC of type 5 NtC Index: 0 BB00 is 750.041
# 339  RMSD Angle sum for NtC of type 5 NtC Index: 0 AA00 is 60.3497
# 339  RMSD Angle sum for NtC of type 5 NtC Index: 0 AAS1 is 282.856
# 339  RMSD Angle sum for NtC of type 5 NtC Index: 0 BB17 is 887.692
# 339  RMSD Angle sum for NtC of type 5 NtC Index: 0 OP06 is 356.499
# 339  RMSD Angle sum for NtC of type 5 NtC Index: 0 IC02 is 425.111
#  = RMSD Angle sum for NtC of type 5 NtC Index: 0 AB03 is 661.212
#
# You are looking for the lowest squared angle sum, so voila, it is AA00.
