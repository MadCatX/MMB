# All forces (including base pairing and collision-detecting sphere forces) are inactive for scrubberPeriod*(dutyCycle-1) picoseconds, and active for scrubberPeriod*dutyCycle picoseconds.  Note that dutyCycle defaults to 1.0:
dutyCycle .9

# add collision-detecting steric spheres to all atoms except hydrogen.  Note that the radius and stiffness of these spheres is set with the excludedVolumeRadius and excludedVolumeStiffness parameters:
